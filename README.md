# Hello, Iâ€™m Soniaâœ¨!

I am a protocol developer ðŸ‘¾, [writer](https://realchainlife.github.io/blog/archive), and [speaker](https://realchainlife.github.io/portfolio/speaking). Iâ€™m passionate about the decentralized web and all the endless possibilities within it! I believe that it is not enough to know and be willingâ€”we must act. ðŸ’» ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [Porium](https://github.com/porium/porium-specs), a web3-focused distributed online learning platform. Let's connect, you can also find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/realChainLife).
